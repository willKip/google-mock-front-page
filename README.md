# Google Mock Homepage
A rebuild of Google's iconic homepage for getting familiar with the front-end languages, demonstrating basic skill with HTML and CSS.

It aims to be aesthetically similar to the Google front page, with basic functionality such as scaling elements, buttons, or search forms in place. There are no functional links.
